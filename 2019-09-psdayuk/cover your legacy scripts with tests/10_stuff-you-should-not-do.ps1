<# here you are substituting two different scenarios 
1) the mock should return different values for different paramteters, in that case make two mocks, with appropriate -parameters filters (Say first Get-User call is to get user Jakub, and the second call is to get user named Jaap).
2) You are testing against environment bound or non-determenistic cmdlet, like get-random, or get-date, which does not take any parameters. In that case you should extract the behavior to a separate function that takes two different inputs, and test that.
